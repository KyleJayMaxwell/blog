I am Kyle J. Maxwell, a California-born, Colorado-raised asian developer. I love experiencing the immense city, with the urban art that is all around, and the unique style of clothing it contains. Fashion is and has been very important to me. Currently I am a broke college student, scrounging around for any design or developing gig I can get, but wouldn't want to be doing anything else.
